### Zip code finder

A simple application built in React to search and display address 
information from a Brazilian zip code (CEP). The project uses the 
public ViaCEP API to query the data.

How to run:

   ```bash
   > git clone https://github.com/vittordallacqua/zip-search.git
   > cd zip-search
   ```

   Install the dependencies:
   
   ```bash
   > npm install
   ```

   Run:

   ```bash
   > npm start
   ```

The application will start in development mode and will be available
at ```http://localhost:3000``` in your browser.
